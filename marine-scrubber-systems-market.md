<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Scrubber Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li><li>Membrane Scrubbers</li><li>Dry Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine scrubber systems market includes various types designed to reduce emissions from ships. Open loop scrubbers use seawater to neutralize sulfur oxides, discharging treated water back into the ocean. Closed loop scrubbers recirculate a freshwater solution, neutralizing gases internally, making them environmentally friendly. Hybrid scrubbers can operate in both modes, adapting to regulations. Membrane scrubbers utilize selective permeable membranes for gas separation, while dry scrubbers employ solid absorbents to capture pollutants, offering diverse solutions for maritime compliance.</p></p>
